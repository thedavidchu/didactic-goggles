# esc180_assorted_functions

Fun assorted functions from my ESC180 class taught by Professor Nebu Mathai. Both C and Python coding!

These functions deal with:
>Linked lists
>Gaussian Elimination
>Histograms
>etc.

Not guaranteed bug free! I just pulled these functions out for fun! The C code may not work... I don't have a compiler handy.
